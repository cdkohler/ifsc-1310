    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>What is Progressive Enhancment? My definition on Progressive Enhancement is that it is a way to code a document, page, or website in layers.
    It is how we have coded this semester to create this homepage. How ProgressiveEnhancement starts is with the HTML, then it moves to the
    CSS, and finialy the JAVA script. when you have all these "layers" done you have a finshed document or website modeled withe the style of Progressive Enhancement. </p>
 <p>Progressive Enhancement is important in modern web design because it is very simple and allows for everyone to add on to a page if they choose to.
 this allows for the people building the website or page to make the best possible they can, and to do so very easily. So a short description of how Progressive Enhancment
 is important is that is is a simple way of coding that provides the become possible outcome for a webiste.</p>

    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection Assignment</h2>
    <p>This semester in Web Technologies has taught my many new things. First of all, It has taught me codeing in HTML, CSS, and JAVA script. I had never doing coding in 
    these languages before. Everything was taught very nicely and easy to understand. So wehn startting the SpaceX Dragon assignment I felt really good about it. 
    But, once I had finished it, I knew there were things that I could have done differently. What I liked about what I did was the way I used inages in the background. To me, 
    I thought this really brought out the page and when I showed it to my parents to see what they thought, they said the same thing.</p>
    <p>From the feedback I recieved from my professor and my parents, I knew I needed to add more to the FAQ and history pages. I had done the minimum for those, so now I am 
    adding on to them to make them look nicer and well done. To do this I am using the JAVA we previously learned to had a slide show in the history page. I also made changes to 
    the images i added because i was using urls. So, I added the images to my folder and now the html and CSS pull the images from my image folders. what I would have done
    differently was not make mutiple stlye sheets for my index files and just use one and same with the image folders. I decided to not change my FAQ page very much because I felt
    that pictures and designs would draw people away from the purpose of an FAQ page. This page is for information that people can easily read and not be distracted.  </p>
